# Stiks

Cheesy little module for building Node apps. Helpers for common tasks like cleaning dirs, copying files, bumping project version and handling ts-node register calls for use with testing frameworks.

For now no examples or docs. if you would like to see how this is used see http://github.com/origin1tech/react-typescript-webpack-mustr. Look in the "build" directory and it will make sense.
