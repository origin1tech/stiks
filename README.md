# Stiks

Cheesy little module for building Node apps. Helpers for common tasks like cleaning dirs, copying files, bumping project version and handling ts-node register calls for use with TypeScript and testing frameworks.

For now no examples. If you would like to see how this is used see. Look in the "build" directory and it will likely make sense.
